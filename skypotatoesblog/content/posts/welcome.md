Last night I followed [this tutorial][y_src] to build this blog that runs off a github repo. I thought
this would be a better way to keep a track of my progress as a coder than merely keeping a repo filled with commented .js files, which I was doing [here][g_src]. I thought about moving everything over and formatting each item as a blog post, but I don't think that's really necessary. This blog will be used for updates and thoughts
on problems I am working on and things that I am learning.

Today was Day 2 of the Northcoders bootcamp which I am enrolled on. Today we covered functions and objects, and solved a bunch of problems kept over [here][intro_src]. Most of what we covered today was a reminder of things I have already learned through FreeCodeCamp and solving katas on Codewars. I believe I used a few
object methods that I haven't used before, but don't remember which off the top of my head. It was mainly a matter of googling to find an appropriate method for the job. It seems like
that is a key skill for a coder.

That's all for now, see you on the next post.
